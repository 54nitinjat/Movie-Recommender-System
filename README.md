# Movie-Recommender-System
A content-based movie recommender system built with Python and Streamlit. It suggests similar movies using NLP and cosine similarity on movie overviews. The app provides an interactive interface to select a movie and get top 5 recommendations based on content similarity.


# Files included in this project:

1.app.py: The main Streamlit app that runs the recommender system
2.Movie_recommendation_system.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used to build the model
3.movie_list.pkl: Contains the list of all movies with their details
4.similarity.pkl: Contains the precomputed similarity scores
